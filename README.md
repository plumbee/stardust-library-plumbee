#stardust-library-plumbee

Fork of the Stardust particle engine. 

First commit is exactly the same as Stardust 1.3.186.

###Changes from the original library:
- Bugfixes and new features for the 2D part of the library.
- Classes that act as handlers for 3D libraries are removed because most of them are not in development anymore or the handlers are written for very old versions. Furthermore they introduce lots of dependencies to the library. This means the following packages:   
    - threeD/alternativa3d  
    - threeD/away3d  
    - threeD/away3dlite  
    - threeD/flare3d  
    - threeD/nd3d  
    - threeD/papervision3d   
    - threeD/zedbox
